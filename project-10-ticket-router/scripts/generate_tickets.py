"""Generate the synthetic English helpdesk-ticket corpus for Project 10.

This script is infrastructure only: it builds train/validation/test
splits plus a small robustness set (``hard_cases.csv``) from
template-based sentence generation. It does not train, fit, or ship any
classifier — that is student work (``starter/student_core.py``).

Usage
-----
    python3.11 scripts/generate_tickets.py --seed 42
    python3.11 scripts/generate_tickets.py --seed 2026 --out-dir /tmp/fixtures

Re-running with the same ``--seed`` and default ``--total`` must produce
byte-identical CSV files (verified against ``data/SHA256SUMS``).
