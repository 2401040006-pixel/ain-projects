"""Optional tokenizer / representation helpers — infrastructure only.

These functions turn raw ticket text into tokens or a bag-of-words count
vector. They are provided so you can skip repetitive string-cleanup code;
using them is optional and you are free to replace them with your own
tokenization, n-grams, or a library vectorizer (e.g.
``sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`` / ``TfidfVectorizer``).

Nothing in this file trains, fits, or predicts anything. The graded AI
core (representation choice, model training, and prediction) belongs in
``starter/student_core.py``.
